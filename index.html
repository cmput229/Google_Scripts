      <p> For group activity on Zoom, it is often convenient to randomly asign students to groups of three or four people and to have each group working on the same document. One way to do this is to create a document on a  Google drive and then to create multiple copies of the same document so that each group can collectively work on a shared document. However, it would consume valuable synchronous time to distribute the documents to the groups. One solution is to create copies of the document that can be easily found by the participants based on the Zoom room that they got assigned to. </p>
      <p> Sharing the entire folder with all participants in the meeting ahead of time would allow all participants to access all the documents in the shared folder -- this arrangement pressuposes a honour system where participants will only access the file for their room. For a given class at the University of Alberta, the instructor can sharr the folder with a user such as <code>grp-fall20-xxxxx123-lec-a1@ualberta.ca</code>, where <code>fall</code> indicated the term, <code>20</code> indicates the year, <code>xxxxx123</code> is the course, and <code>a1</code> is the session.</p>
      <p>For example, lets assume that we want to have a tic-tat-toe game tournament in each group of four participants during a sychronous meeting. We will create a file named <code>Tic-tac-toe-game</code> in a folder named <code>Tic-tac-toe</code>. Lets assume that there will be up to twenty groups in the synchronous session. Now we need to create twenty copies of this file and we would like to name them as follow:
      <ul>
	<li> Room 1: Tic-tac-toe-game</li>
	<li> Room 2: Tic-tac-toe-game</li>
	<li> ...</li>
	<li> Room 3: Tic-tac-toe-game</li>
      </ul>
      This is where the participation document duplication script.
